# Fix Backend File Upload and Caching Issues

## Problem Summary

Uploaded files (PDFs, text files) are not appearing in the "Ingested Files" or "File Status" sections of the RAG UI, despite successful uploads. Root causes include:

1. Missing workspace context during file ingestion
2. Database path resolution issues in corpus endpoints
3. Unpopulated workspace column in `corpus_files` table
4. Uvicorn server not reloading code changes

## âœ… COMPLETED - All Issues Resolved

The following fixes have been implemented and verified to be working:

### 1. âœ… Workspace Context Propagation

**File**: `src/uamm/api/routes.py`

- Lines 1607-1611 (`rag_upload_file` endpoint)
- Lines 1647-1651 (`rag_upload_files` endpoint)
- **Fix**: Create settings object with workspace information before calling `scan_folder()`
- **Status**: âœ… VERIFIED - Files now correctly associated with selected workspace

### 2. âœ… Database Path Resolution in Corpus Endpoints

**File**: `src/uamm/api/routes.py`

- Lines 1923-1926 (`workspace_corpus_list` endpoint)
- Lines 1972-1975 (`workspace_corpus_files` endpoint)
- **Fix**: Use `request.state.db_path` instead of `settings.db_path`
- **Status**: âœ… VERIFIED - Endpoints now query correct workspace-specific database

### 3. âœ… Workspace Column Population

**File**: `src/uamm/rag/ingest.py`

- Lines 401-404 (skipped files case)
- Lines 552-555 (successful ingestion case)
- **Fix**: Populate workspace column in INSERT statements
- **Status**: âœ… VERIFIED - Workspace column populated for all file records

### 4. âœ… Improved Filtering Logic

**File**: `src/uamm/api/routes.py`

- Lines 1988-1999 (`workspace_corpus_files` endpoint)
- **Fix**: Use workspace-based filtering with path-based fallback
- **Status**: âœ… VERIFIED - Files correctly filtered by workspace

### 5. âœ… Schema Consistency

**File**: `src/uamm/rag/ingest.py` (lines 214-220)

- Updated `_ensure_corpus_files_table()` to include workspace column in CREATE statement
- **Status**: âœ… VERIFIED - Schema consistent across all initialization paths

### 6. âœ… Modal Accessibility Fix

**File**: `src/uamm/api/static/js/components/uamm-rag-page.mjs`

- Fixed Bootstrap modal focus management issues
- Added proper `aria-hidden` attribute handling
- **Status**: âœ… VERIFIED - Modal dialogs work without accessibility warnings

## âœ… Verification Results

### Backend API Testing
- âœ… `/workspaces/alvaro/corpus` returns all 5 documents with workspace='alvaro'
- âœ… `/workspaces/alvaro/corpus/files` returns files with workspace field populated
- âœ… Document counts match database (5 documents)

### UI Integration Testing
- âœ… Uploaded files appear immediately in "Ingested Files (recent)" section
- âœ… Files show in "File Status" section with correct status badges
- âœ… Upload queue displays during upload process with proper styling
- âœ… Workspace context preserved throughout (sidebar shows "D:5 S:0")
- âœ… Modal accessibility fixed - no more aria-hidden focus warnings

### End-to-End File Upload Flow
- âœ… File selection works correctly
- âœ… Upload process shows progress and completion status
- âœ… Files automatically appear in both ingested files and file status lists
- âœ… No manual refresh required
- âœ… Workspace isolation maintained

## âœ… Expected Outcomes - ALL ACHIEVED

- âœ… All uploaded files appear immediately in UI after upload
- âœ… Files correctly filtered by workspace
- âœ… No manual refresh required
- âœ… File status displayed during upload process
- âœ… Database queries use correct workspace-specific paths
- âœ… Modal dialogs accessible without focus conflicts

## Summary

**ðŸŽ‰ ALL ISSUES SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED!**

The file upload system is now fully functional with:
- Proper workspace context propagation
- Correct database path resolution
- Complete workspace column population
- Automatic UI refresh after upload
- Accessible modal dialogs
- Real-time status updates

The system now provides a seamless user experience where files upload, process, and appear in the UI automatically without requiring manual intervention or browser refreshes.
